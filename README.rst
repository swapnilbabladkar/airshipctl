Airshipctl
==========

Airshipctl is a command-line interface that enables users to manage declarative
infrastructure and software.

Airshipctl aims to provide a seamless experience for operators wishing to
leverage the best open source options such as the `Cluster API`_, `Metal
Kubed`_, Kustomize_, and kubeadm_ by providing a straight forward and easily
approachable interface.

This project is the heart of our effort to produce Airship 2.0, which has
three main evolutions from `Airship 1.0`_:

* Expand our use of entrenched upstream projects.
* Embrace Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) â€“ everything becomes an
  object in Kubernetes.
* Make the Airship control plane ephemeral.

To learn more about the Airship 2.0 evolution, reference the
`Airship blog series`_.
