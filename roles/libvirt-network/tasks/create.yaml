# Description:
#   Creates a libvirt network. libvirt_network are
#   exactly converted to XML from YAML so there
#   is no validation whether the arguments are
#   correct or not. Caller must ensure that yaml
#   is formulated correctly.
#
# Inputs:
#   network_action: "create"
#   libvirt_network:
#     name: <name of network>
#     persistent: <boolean>
#     autostart: <boolean>
#     recreate: <boolean>

#       forward:

#         nat:
#           port:
