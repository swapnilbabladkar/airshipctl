# To display all the expiring entities in the cluster
airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration --kubeconfig testconfig

# To display the entities whose expiration is within threshold of 30 days
airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -t 30 --kubeconfig testconfig

# To output the contents to json (default operation)
airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -o json --kubeconfig testconfig
or
airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration --kubeconfig testconfig

# To output the contents to yaml
airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -o yaml --kubeconfig testconfig

# To output the contents whose expiration is within 30 days to yaml
airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -t 30 -o yaml --kubeconfig testconfig
